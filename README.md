### Key takeaways
| URL              | Key takeaways | 
|------------------|--------------|
|(https://hrservice.iium.edu.my) | The scan revealed *2 medium-risk vulnerabilities* that impact client-side security (missing CSP and anti-clickjacking headers). These should be addressed soon. No critical or high-risk issues were found. Two informational findings were also recorded. | 
| (http://hrservice.iium.edu.my/apariium) | The scan reveals several medium to high-risk vulnerabilities that expose the site to threats like cross-site scripting, clickjacking, and insecure cross-origin access. The absence of key security headers such as CSP and X-Frame-Options, combined with outdated JavaScript libraries, increases the risk of code injection and unauthorized access. Immediate attention should be given to implementing proper security headers, updating vulnerable components, and reviewing cross-domain policies to reduce the siteâ€™s exposure to common web attacks.|

## Evaluation of Vulnerabilities
URL: https://hrservice.iium.edu.my/
- Cross-Domain Misconfiguration: This could allow attackers to load or manipulate external resources
- Missing Anti-clickjacking Header: Without X-Frame-Options or Content-Security-Policy, the site is vulnerable to clickjacking attacks â€” tricking users into clicking hidden elements embedded via iframes. This is a common and preventable issue.
- Vulnerable JavaScript Library: Usage of an outdated JS library (linked to a known CVE) can open the application to a wide range of exploits including XSS or logic manipulation, depending on the vulnerability. This is a serious issue if the library is actively used.
- Information Disclosure in URL: 	Sensitive tokens in URLs are risky because they may be logged in browser history or server logs. In the worst case, a leaked token could allow session hijacking or unauthorized access.


URL: http://hrservice.iium.edu.my/apariium
- Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set: Without CSP, the site is more exposed to XSS and code injection attacks.
- Cross-Domain Misconfiguration: Misconfigured cross-domain policies can allow unauthorized domains to access sensitive resources.
- Missing Anti-clickjacking Header: Lack of headers like X-Frame-Options makes the site vulnerable to clickjacking attacks.
- Vulnerable JS Library: Using outdated or insecure JavaScript libraries can expose the site to known exploits.


URL: http://hrservice.iium.edu.my/adm
- Lack of Security Headers:The absence of important security headers such as Content Security Policy (CSP) and anti-CSRF tokens exposes the application to common web threats, including cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.
- Session and Cookie Security Weaknesses:The scan detected missing security attributes in session management and cookies (e.g., missing HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite flags), which increases the risk of session hijacking and unauthorized access via browser-based attacks.
- Use of Outdated or Vulnerable Components:The presence of vulnerable JavaScript libraries (e.g., old Bootstrap version) can introduce exploitable weaknesses, allowing attackers to leverage known vulnerabilities if not promptly updated.
- Potential Information Disclosure:Informational issues, such as session management response identification, may not be directly exploitable but could aid attackers in gathering intelligence about the applicationâ€™s structure and behavior, potentially supporting future attacks.

## Prevention Measures
URL: https://hrservice.iium.edu.my/
| Vulnerability                 | Recommendation                                  |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Cross-Domain Misconfiguration | Limit cross-origin access using strict CORS rules. Do not allow unauthenticated or public domains to load critical resources. |
| Missing Anti-clickjacking Header | Implement one of the following HTTP headers: X-Frame-Options: DENY or SAMEORIGIN, Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none'; |
| Vulnerable JS Library | Check which library is affected (e.g., jQuery, Bootstrap). Update to the latest version after verifying compatibility. Avoid using unsupported or unmaintained libraries. |
| Information Disclosure in URL | Move sensitive tokens (e.g., session tickets) into secure HTTP headers or encrypted cookies instead of placing them in GET URLs. Also consider using POST for secure data exchange. |

URL: http://hrservice.iium.edu.my/apariium
| Vulnerability                 | Recommendation                                  |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set | Add a CSP header to control which sources the browser is allowed to load content from. This helps prevent cross-site scripting and code injection attacks. |
| Cross-Domain Misconfiguration | Limit access to your siteâ€™s resources by only allowing trusted domains. Avoid using wildcards (*) in cross-origin settings. |
| Missing Anti-clickjacking Header | Use security headers like X-Frame-Options or Content-Security-Policy to prevent your site from being embedded in other pages, which protects against clickjacking. |
| Vulnerable JS Library | Keep all JavaScript libraries up to date. Remove unused ones and avoid using versions with known security issues. |

URL: http://hrservice.iium.edu.my/adm
| Vulnerability                 | Recommendation                                  |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set| Configure your web server or application to set the Content-Security-Policy header. This helps prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) and other code injection attacks by restricting the sources of content that browsers are allowed to load. |
| Absence of Anti-CSRF Tokens              | Implement anti-CSRF tokens on all forms and sensitive state-changing requests to protect users from cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. |
| Vulnerable JavaScript Library Detected            | Regularly update and maintain all third-party libraries and dependencies (such as JavaScript frameworks). Replace outdated or vulnerable libraries with their latest, secure versions to prevent attackers from exploiting known issues. |
| Session Management Response Identified                       | Review and harden session management mechanisms. Ensure that session tokens are generated securely, transmitted over HTTPS, and properly invalidated after logout. Avoid exposing unnecessary session details in responses. |
