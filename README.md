## Evaluation of Vulnerabilities
URL: https://hrservice.iium.edu.my/
- Cross-Domain Misconfiguration: This could allow attackers to load or manipulate external resources
- Missing Anti-clickjacking Header: Without X-Frame-Options or Content-Security-Policy, the site is vulnerable to clickjacking attacks â€” tricking users into clicking hidden elements embedded via iframes. This is a common and preventable issue.
- Vulnerable JavaScript Library: Usage of an outdated JS library (linked to a known CVE) can open the application to a wide range of exploits including XSS or logic manipulation, depending on the vulnerability. This is a serious issue if the library is actively used.
- Information Disclosure in URL: 	Sensitive tokens in URLs are risky because they may be logged in browser history or server logs. In the worst case, a leaked token could allow session hijacking or unauthorized access.

## Prevention Measures
URL: https://hrservice.iium.edu.my/
| Vulnerability                 | Recommendation                                  |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Cross-Domain Misconfiguration | Limit cross-origin access using strict CORS rules. Do not allow unauthenticated or public domains to load critical resources. |
| Missing Anti-clickjacking Header | Implement one of the following HTTP headers: X-Frame-Options: DENY or SAMEORIGIN, Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none'; |
| Vulnerable JS Library | Check which library is affected (e.g., jQuery, Bootstrap). Update to the latest version after verifying compatibility. Avoid using unsupported or unmaintained libraries. |
| Information Disclosure in URL | Move sensitive tokens (e.g., session tickets) into secure HTTP headers or encrypted cookies instead of placing them in GET URLs. Also consider using POST for secure data exchange. |
